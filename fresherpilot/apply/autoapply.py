"""Auto-apply brain. The clicking happens in YOUR browser, inside the FresherPilot extension, so your
existing logins are used. This module (served by main.py) does the thinking and keeps the state:

  - builds the queue (one job from its "Auto-apply" button, or your best matches for "Auto-apply all")
  - decides each next step: the extension labels every clickable element with a Vimium-style key and
    sends a snapshot; the LLM answers click <key> / fill / done / skip / needs_user
  - code-level guards (never click Follow/Save/Sign up..., confirmation detection)
  - progress, log, and the Continue / Skip / Stop commands from the app

When a site needs you (sign in, CAPTCHA, verification code, or a question your profile can't
answer), the extension pauses, brings the tab to the front, and the app asks you to finish it and
click Continue.

Workday, Ashby...). The candidate is logged in to the job boards in this browser.
Each step you see the page URL and title, the visible text (of the open dialog if there is one), how many form
fields are visible and empty, the filler status, previous actions, and clickable elements with hint keys.
Reply with ONE action:

- fill       : application form fields are visible and the filler has NOT run on this step yet.
- click      : press the element with that key to move the application forward (elements marked "further down
               the page" are fine; clicking scrolls to them): Easy Apply / Apply / Apply now /
               Apply on company site / Apply for this job / I'm interested, Next, Continue, Save and continue,
               Review, Submit application / Submit. Prefer elements inside the dialog. On a careers page, open
               THIS job's application (not other openings). Accepting necessary cookies is fine.
- done       : the page clearly confirms the application was submitted / sent / applied.
- needs_user : the candidate must act: sign in / log in page, create an account, CAPTCHA, email/OTP/phone code,
               or a question that can't be answered from their profile. Say exactly what they need to do.
- skip       : the job is closed / no longer accepting applications / already applied, or the flow needs something
               that can't be done (video interview, live test). Give the reason.

Never click: Save (job), Follow, Share, Message, Dismiss, Discard, Cancel, Back, Sign in / Log in / Create account /
Sign up (ask the candidate instead), social login buttons, ads, other job listings, premium/upsell, profile/settings
links, cookie "reject"/settings. key is "" unless action is click."""
